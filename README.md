# DataStories 
Project code for Data Stories Class

# Functionality
* RAKE algorithm (implemented by ) automatically extracts keywords from song lyrics dataset
* We've found out that pixabay is a much better image dataset than COCO
* We have an example of the parser and pixabay parser working now
* Just need to find a way to make it run through the whole set quickly
* Possibly using a Hastable with a linked list implementation with key being string containing song name and value being a list of images
* Need to worry about scalability 


# Sources
* Data set (songdata.csv) can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics)
