# DataStories 
Project code for Data Stories Class

# Functionality
* Test out RAKE algorithm (implemented by [rake_nltk](https://github.com/csurfer/rake-nltk)) to automatically extract keywords from song lyrics (songdata.csv)
* We need to use an image searcher API to find the relevant images 
* Then create an evalutor (Google Vision API) to see if they're actually relevant to the real keywords


# Sources
Data set (songdata.csv) can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics)
