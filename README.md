# DataStories 
Project code for Data Stories Class

# Functionality
* Test out RAKE algorithm (implemented by [rake_nltk](https://github.com/csurfer/rake-nltk)) to automatically extract keywords from song lyrics (songdata.csv) --> DONE
* We've found out that pixabay is a much better image dataset than COCO
* We have an example of the parser and pixabay parser working now
* Just need to find a way to make it run through the whole set quickly
* Possibly using a Hastable with a linked list implementation


# Sources
Data set (songdata.csv) can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mousehead/songlyrics)
